# JaPi_Technical_Assessment

Repo for JaPi Technical Assessment using Flask Framework; a lightweight, flexible, and micro web framework written in Python, designed for building web applications and APIs. Furthermore, I utilized Supabase, which is an open-source platform that provides a hosted PostgreSQL database and a suite of tools, acting as a backend-as-a-service (BaaS) alternative to Firebase.
